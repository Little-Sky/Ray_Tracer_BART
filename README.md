# Ray_Tracer_BART

This is a practicing project implementing ideas in the book "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", and use BART as the Test Set.

Started this Wednesday (21-Dec-2016), and I tried to finished it within this weekend.

Friday update (23-Dec), I just finish reading the book roughly. Though many still not undertood, I started the coding process today. Upload the 3D basics first.
