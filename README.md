Due to the Christmas party held yesterday night, I woke up late today and lost almost one day's time. Re-read the book for the second time, but still quite confused about the Acceleration techniques Chapter (Chatper 3 skipped). 

Anyway, the coding progress will be started tomorrow, and a basic version will be first implemented.
