Backward ray tracing

Shadow feeler sends shadow ray to light source to check whether it is a illumination ray.

Among all illuminating light, we only cares propagated light, which are (specular / diffuse) * (reflection / transmission) (4 types).

From eyes, we trace incident ray / eye ray / pixel ray to objects, and using surface normal to determine the direction of transmitted ray and reflected ray.

Recursively creates a ray tree and traverse on it.
Stops when we leave the scene OR contribution to the final image gets too small (reflect and transmit percent) -> called adaptive tree-depth control.

Aliasing (spatial or temporal) is a fundamental problem of sampling any signal in signal processing.

Anti-aliasing:  
	Spatial: motion blurring
	Temporal: [adaptive] supersampling (deterministic / stochastic)

Stochastic/ distributed ray tracing coincidently reduce the diffuse rays tracing problem by introducing noise, and hopefully, it will send more transmitted rays to directions where various lights come. (It also helps in depth of field and soft edges on shadows)

Statistical supersampling evaluates the “percentage of likelihood” of a right colour to determine how many rays are sent for each pixel.
