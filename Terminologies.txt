Summary of "A Introduction to Ray Tracing"

Backward ray tracing

Shadow feeler sends shadow ray to light source to check whether it is a illumination ray.

Among all illuminating light, we only cares propagated light, which are (specular / diffuse) * (reflection / transmission) (4 types).

From eyes, we trace incident ray / eye ray / pixel ray to objects, and using surface normal to determine the direction of transmitted ray and reflected ray.

Recursively creates a ray tree and traverse on it.
Stops when we leave the scene OR contribution to the final image gets too small (reflect and transmit percent) -> called adaptive tree-depth control.

Aliasing (spatial or temporal) is a fundamental problem of sampling any signal in signal processing.

Anti-aliasing:  
    Spatial: motion blurring
    Temporal: [adaptive] supersampling (deterministic / stochastic)

Stochastic/ distributed ray tracing coincidently reduce the diffuse rays tracing problem by introducing noise, and hopefully, it will send more transmitted rays to directions where various lights come. (It also helps in depth of field and soft edges on shadows)

Statistical supersampling evaluates the “percentage of likelihood” of a right colour to determine how many rays are sent for each pixel.

Chapter 4 Surface Physics

All objects have their resonant frequency, where they reflects the most.

Metamers are spectrally different but perceptually equivalent colors -> no correct spectrum for “orange”; they all look exactly the same 
((frequency vs. amplitude) plot vs. perception)

Perfect Specular Reflection
    - Incident ray I, Normal N, Reflection ray R (all unit vector)
    - R = I - 2*(N*I)N
    
Perfect Diffuse Reflection(Lambertian reflection model):
    - Amount diffuse is proportional to cos(θ)

Perfect Specular Transmission:
    - sin (θ1) / sin (θ2) = η2 / η1, where η is index of refraction
    - Total internal reflection (page 146) condition 1+ηit (Ci)*N > 0? 

Perfect Diffuse Transmission
    - ≈ Perfect diffuse reflection, proportion to cos (θ)

Shading Model is used in real life to handle rough surface & color shifting.
    - Simplified version using light vectors: ray arrive from light vector (reflected, transmitted, and shadow), and depart from viewing vector (incident ray).
    - Shadow ray now becomes illumination ray, and we calculate how much light is headed in the direction of the viewing vector.


An Applicable Shading Model (page 152-155)
    - Consider reflected ray = diffuse + specular components
    - Idr(λ) = Ilj(λ)*Fdr(λ)*(N*L)
      diffusely reflected light = spectrum of light source j * diffuse reflection curve * (surface normal * light vector)

    - Microfacet model for perfect reflections on rough plane (page 154)
        - The color and intensity of the specularly reflected light leaving a  given point may be dependent on the direction and color of the incoming light, ht ecolor of the object, and the distribution of the microfacets on the surface
        - Larger θ -> more bounces -> heavier colored by the material
        - Setting: V, Lj, N, (Lj is the light vector from light source j), then draw Hj bisect V and Lj. Name angle (V, Hj) = θ, angle(Hj, N) = α (For transmit, only put Lj to the other side).
        
A faster Shader: 
It is a common technique to debug your images with a faster, cheaper shading model, and then produce the final high-quality renderings with a more accurate shading equation.

The Hall Shading Model: (page 160)
8 types: 
  Light source: light source / other bodies
  Light path:   reflection / transmission
  Surface type: specular / diffuse  
5 factors:
  Diffuse from other bodies are regards as "ambient" term and diffuse transmission from light sources is ignored.

Chapter 5 Stochastic Sampling & Distributed Ray Tracing
*******************************************************

Poisson disk sampling, by sampling beyond Nyquist limit, is used by human eyes to reduce aliasing problems.

We use jittering to approximate poisson disk sampling - from regularly spaced sample, each sample adds a random variable to make sure that all space are equally likely to be sampled.

Consider a pixel as a regular grid of one or more rectangular subpixels, each with one sample point. Each sample point is placed in the middle of a subpixel, and then noise is added to the x and y locations independently so that each sample point occurs at some random location within its subpixel.

Radiosity method and cone tracing.

If the rendering integral is evaluated with stocahstic sampling, and we perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of the integrals by stochastically distributing the sample points (rays) in those additional dimensions (the integral variables are viewed as another dimension)/ This is claled probabilitic ray tracing or distributed ray tracing.
    e.g. Distributing reflected ray according to the speecular distribution function produces gloss (blurry reflection)
         Distributing rays in time produces motion blur.

Simulate depth of field: (page 182)
    Postprocessing approach: each object is first rendered in sharp focus, and then convolved with a filter the size of the circle of confusion. 
    However, this never be completely correct. Because visibility is calculated form a single point. (e.g. different parts of lens' visibility may differs)

Motion blur: distributing the rays or sample points in time.


??? page 205 "By using different distributions of rays, the motion can be blurred with a box filter or a weighted filter or can be strobed?" What is box filter and weighted filter?

Implement of distributed ray tracing
1. Nonspatial jittering
    Distribute rays in the additional dimension using uncoreelated random values always lead to noisy image. So we'd better use jittering to mimic poisson disk distribution.
    




Efficiency & Bugs
p81:  Simplify formulas first and then do the calculations (associative laws A*B+A*C = A*(B+C) improves efficiency!)

eps = 1e-10 && using long double

p205: Care must be taken in bounding moving objects. The bound should depend on time so that the number of potentially visible objects does not grow unacceptably with their speed.
